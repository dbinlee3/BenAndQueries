const CPLUSPLUS = "This is a program I wrote in C++ in February of 2022. It takes in a file and uses efficient encoding in order to compress the file into bits. This project covers advanced data structure topics such as the Huffman Tree data structure, priority queues, and an efficient encoding algorithm to compress and decompress a given file."
